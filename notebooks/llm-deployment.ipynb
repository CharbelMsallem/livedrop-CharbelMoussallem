After they sign up, they get an email with a link to confirm their registration. They have 24 hours to click the link to finish the onboarding process.\\n\\nUsers can log in and go to their account dashboard to change their personal information, like their shipping address, saved payment methods, and communication preferences. Customers can also turn on notifications for sales, price drops, and updates on deliveries. Accounts support single sign-in (SSO) options through Google and Apple IDs for convenience. This makes it easy to get to access an account without having to enter any credentials over and over again.\\n\\nFor sellers to register on Shoplite, they must provide registered business proof, a valid tax ID, and bank account details, with verification typically taking two to three business days. Once approved, they can create sub-accounts for employees with role-based permissions. Shoplite ensures security with hashed passwords (SHA-256), JWT-based authentication, and temporary account locks after multiple failed login attempts. Developers using the Shoplite API for authentication must follow OAuth2.0 standards, utilizing refresh tokens for secure access.\\n\\nAccount recovery is also prioritized. Users who forget their passwords can reset them through an emailed recovery link that remains valid for only 15 minutes. For enhanced protection, recovery requests are logged and monitored by Shoplite's fraud detection system.\\n\\nBy balancing ease of use with robust safeguards, Shoplite ensures that account registration and management provide a seamless yet secure experience for all users.\",\n",

As users type, auto-suggestions show up thanks to predictive text algorithms that look at popular searches and the user's own browsing history.\\n\\nFiltering options let shoppers have full control over the results of their searches. Price range, product category, brand, seller rating, shipping speed, and stock availability are all examples of core filters. Extra advanced filters make it easy to find \\\"Shoplite Verified Sellers,\\\" eco-friendly products, or items that can be delivered the same day. Results can be sorted by how relevant they are, how low the price is, how high the rating is, or how new they are. A comparison tool displays several items next to each other, which helps making an informed choice without leaving the search results page.\\n\\nThe technical architecture of Shoplite's search engine utilizes Elasticsearch for real-time indexing of product data, applying Boolean filters to streamline searches. Caching mechanisms allow rapid retrieval of frequently searched terms, even under high traffic, while machine learning enhances personalized recommendations. Developers can enhance functionality through Shoplite's API at the `/products/search` endpoint, which supports keyword and filter parameters, returning JSON results suitable for integration. Rate limits maintain system stability, with support for bulk operations via pagination tokens.\\n\\nFrom a customer perspective, these tools make finding products efficient and enjoyable. From a technical perspective, the modular search and filter system guarantees scalability as Shoplite continues to expand its product ecosystem, ensuring that both end-users and developers benefit from a robust, future-ready infrastructure.\",\n",

Customers can also save promotional codes in their account wallets to use later on.\\n\\nOn the backend, Shoplite uses a dedicated Discount Service to validate and apply promotions in real time. Each code has unique identifiers, usage limits (single-use or multi-use), and expiration dates. Sellers can generate bulk codes for loyalty programs or personalized single-use codes for targeted marketing campaigns.\\n\\nFor developers, the `/discounts/apply` API endpoint provides programmatic validation of codes, enabling integration with custom checkout systems or external CRMs. Webhooks notify sellers when promotions are redeemed, helping them measure campaign success.\\n\\nAnalytics dashboards let sellers stay updated on how well they're doing by showing them things like redemption rates, revenue impact, and customer acquisition metrics. This helps companies improve their advertising plans over time.\\n\\nShoplite makes sure that promotional codes and discounts not only boost sales but also build long-term customer loyalty by being flexible, easy to use, and having strong technical support.\",\n",

        "        \"content\": \"Shoplite has a full set of analytics tools that lets both buyers and sellers see how they are using the platform. Buyers can look at their purchase history, see how much they've spent in different categories, and get recommendations based on what they've bought in the past. Sellers, on the other hand, can see detailed reporting dashboards that show things like sales performance, product trends, customer demographics, and return rates.\\n\\nOne of the key strengths of Shoplite analytics is its real-time updating. Data is updated almost instantly after each sale, so sellers can make quick decisions based on the data. Reports can be filtered by time period, product line, or region, which makes it easy to analyse the data. Predictive analytics also show how demand changes with the seasons, which helps businesses get ready for busy times like the holidays.\\n\\nExport options are available in CSV, Excel, and JSON formats, which makes it easy to move data into third-party BI tools like Tableau or Power BI. Shoplite has dedicated API endpoints for technical users, such as `/analytics/sales` and `/analytics/customers`, which provide raw data for integrations into custom dashboards. Rate limits apply, but enterprise sellers can request expanded access.\\n\\nAll analytics data is anonymised at the customer level to protect their privacy and follow rules like GDPR. Sellers can see general information about their customers, such as their age range or where they live, but they can't see the names of individual customers unless the buyers decide to reveal them during checkout.\\n\\nShoplite's analytics system gives businesses the tools they need to improve their pricing, marketing campaigns, and inventory planning by making it easy to use, adding advanced filtering, and providing developer-friendly APIs. This makes the ecosystem stronger, which helps both sellers and buyers by making things more efficient and personalised.\",\n",

        "        \"content\": \"Maintaining trust across the Shoplite marketplace requires strong defenses against fraud. To achieve this, Shoplite employs a multi-layered risk management framework that protects both buyers and sellers. Suspicious activities—such as repeated failed login attempts, sudden changes in buying patterns, or large-volume orders from new accounts—are flagged in real time by AI-driven monitoring systems.\\n\\nFor buyers, safeguards include two-factor authentication on high-value purchases, automated alerts for unusual account activity, and a dispute resolution channel for fraudulent charges. Refunds in confirmed fraud cases are processed quickly, with Shoplite absorbing costs when sellers are not at fault.\\n\\nRisk scoring on incoming orders helps sellers find orders that might be fake before they ship them. For instance, a manual review may be triggered by billing and shipping addresses that don't match, a high number of refunds, or payment methods that have been flagged. If fraud is suspected, sellers should wait to fulfil the order until the issue is settled.\\n\\nShoplite's fraud detection works with both the Payment Service and the Order Service on the backend. This makes sure that problems are found early in the purchase flow. All flagged transactions are recorded with timestamps, and detailed audit trails are kept for compliance reasons. There are also APIs that let enterprise sellers get fraud alerts directly in their ERP systems.\\n\\nThe system keeps getting enhanced with regular security audits, partnerships with payment gateways, and machine learning models that learn from new types of fraud. This proactive approach lowers the risk of wasting money and boosts buyer confidence.\\n\\nShoplite makes sure that its marketplace is a safe and trusted place for every transaction by using advanced detection technology and clear resolution policies.\",\n",
