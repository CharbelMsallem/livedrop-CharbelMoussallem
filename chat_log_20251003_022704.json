    "response": {
      "confidence": "Medium",
      "response": "Customer support, returns, and secure payments work together to resolve disputes on Shoplite through a combination of automated tools, clear policies, and direct communication channels.

    "query": "How is fraud prevented during checkout and account access?",
    "response": {
      "confidence": "Medium",
      "response": "Fraud prevention during checkout and account access on Shoplite involves several layers of security measures. For account access, Shoplite uses two-factor authentication (2FA) on high-value purchases, automated alerts for unusual activity, and a dispute resolution channel for fraudulent charges. Additionally, accounts are secured with hashed passwords (SHA-256) and temporary locks after multiple failed login attempts. Two-factor authentication can also be enabled for extra security, and account recovery requests are monitored by the fraud detection system.\n\nFor fraud prevention during checkout, Shoplite employs a multi-layered approach. Suspicious activities, such as repeated failed login attempts or sudden changes in buying patterns, are flagged in real time by AI-driven monitoring systems. The platform also uses risk scoring on incoming orders to identify potential fraud. For example, a manual review may be triggered by discrepancies between billing and shipping addresses, a high number of refunds, or payment methods that have been flagged for suspicious activity. Sellers are advised to wait to fulfill the order until the issue is resolved.\n\nBoth the Payment Service and Order Service work together on the backend to detect and prevent fraud early in the purchase flow. Flagged transactions are recorded with timestamps, and detailed audit trails are maintained for compliance purposes. Regular security audits, partnerships with payment gateways, and machine learning models that learn from new types of fraud help enhance the system continuously.",
