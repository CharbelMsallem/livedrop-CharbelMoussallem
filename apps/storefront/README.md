## Available Scripts

### `pnpm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. This will run all the unit tests for the components to ensure everything is working as expected.

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
